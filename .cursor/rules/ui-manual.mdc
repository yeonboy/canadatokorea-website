# UI Manual Rules (Current Concept Preservation)

## Buttons / Toggles
- Use existing `voxy-button` styles for interactive toggles.
- Do not replace with new component libraries; keep minimal DOM with CSS utility classes.
- Toggle groups must be horizontally aligned with 12–16px gaps and wrap on small screens.

## Cards
- Keep current rounded-2xl, border-gray-200/70, shadow-md look.
- Banner: maintain color overlay with type color + black/10 layer for readability.
- Title sizes: list card h3 22–26px; detail page h1 30–32px.

## Typography
- Headings: bold, tight tracking; body: 15–17px with leading-8.
- Locale i18n: prefer `t()` for UI labels; fall back to English when missing.

## Layout
- Maintain max container width `max-w-content` and 64px+ section spacing.
- Map blocks remain within rounded containers; controls above the map use the same button styles.

## Accessibility
- Buttons must have `role`/`aria-checked` when used as toggle radios/checkboxes.
- Map popups/text must remain readable on light theme.

## Do Not
- Do not introduce heavy UI deps or redesign component structure.
- Do not change spacing, font sizes, or color tokens without explicit approval.
